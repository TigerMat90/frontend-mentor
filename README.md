Hi,

HTML
I tried to build a simple structure, so that the code is easily readable.


CSS
I think the result is very close to the solution.

- Footbar has some problems, I don't know what.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:
inspecting the code with devtools it seems to me that it is quite responsive. 
I know I can do better, but I'm still learning the arguments for making a site responsive.

Thanks
